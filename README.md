# ðŸš€ 42 get_next_line ðŸš€

Hey code wizards! This GitHub realm is where I've stashed the 42 get_next_line project, a gem from the 42 course. Take a dive into my coding saga, but remember, tackle the challenges solo before delving into my solutions, alright?

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RPDJF/42-get_next_line.git
