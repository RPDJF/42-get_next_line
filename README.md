# ðŸš€ 42 get_next_line ðŸš€

Hey code wizards! This GitHub realm is where I've stashed the 42 get_next_line project, a gem from the 42 course. Take a dive into my coding saga, but remember, tackle the challenges solo before delving into my solutions, alright?

## What's get_next_line, Anyway?

get_next_line is like a coding riddle that takes you into the world of reading from a file descriptor. It's the ninja move of file reading in C! ðŸ“–ðŸ¥·

## Compile-it! ðŸ’»

Here's the spellbook to conjure your get_next_line masterpiece:

- `make`: Standard enchantment. Compile the code, and you're good to roll!
- `make clean`: Sweep away the traces of your enchantment. A tidy workspace is a powerful workspace.
- `make fclean`: Need a fresh start? This erases all enchantments, leaving nothing behind.
- `make debug`: Unleash the debug sorcery with lldb. Warning: It leaves behind extra mystical artifacts not handled by `make fclean`.

Navigate this enchanted realm with these commands, and may your get_next_line journey be epic! ðŸŒŸðŸ”®

## Cloning the Repository
To embark on this coding adventure, use the command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:RPDJF/42-get_next_line.git
```
